We will meet for breakfast/lunches to discuss our stories and offer support for one another. I will try and offer activities to help us open up, get to know one another better and bring our personal relationships with our own beautiful moms to the forth front. This will be a small, intimate, private group. I'm hoping to gain real, authentic friendships amongst a trusted core group of women who'd like to tell their stories and listen to others as well. I have my own personal tribute to share and often need a hug or someone who can relate to what I'm going through. My mother always said it was 'important to be a good listener.' I'm hoping this journey will help me, as well as other women, find help with their grief, connect on certain levels and rediscover new friendships for our 'forever changed' lives. It's been impossible for me to find what I was really looking for through psychologists, bereavement groups, etc. so, I'm hoping this will be the answer to helping me, as well as others women possibly going through the same thing. There will be a $5 fee for joining this group and will be collected after the first meet-up if you decide this group is for you.\nLooking forward to some everlasting friendships and bringing our moms back to life!",

Many parents approach raising teenagers as an ordeal, believing they can only watch helplessly as their lovable children transform into unpredictable monsters. But that sets you -- and your teen -- up for several unhappy, unsatisfying years together. Your child isn't a little kid anymore. They're a teen, or a tween -- and it's time to tweak your parenting skills to keep up with them. Yes, they're probably moodier now than when they were young. And you have new things to think about, like curfews, dating, new drivers, and friends who make you raise your eyebrows. No doubt about it: Your teen, or tween, will test your limits, and your patience. But they're still your child. And, though they won't admit it, they still need you! The key is knowing what efforts are worth it, and which ones backfire. Join us, other parents and their teenagers and find ways that will help you bridge the gap between you and your teenager (s).",

How do we plan to do that? With your help!\nWe are reaching out to every woman on the planet - every country in the world - to come and travel with us and make friends for life. This is no small feat, but we know that if enough women join Brave Women Travel, our dream can come true. We want you to tell all your friends, your colleagues, your moms, sisters, aunts, cousins…. every woman you know. Come and join Brave Women Travel!\nWhy travel? Well, what better way to create peace and love than to be, let’s say, on a cruise ship surrounded by others with the same mindset; getting away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life on a journey you’ve dreamed of your entire life; or on a trek through the Andes helping others to reach the top, or watching the Northern lights in a land you’ve only dreamed of. Most of us love to travel, to see the world, to see how others live and to be thankful for what we have. With travel we can accomplish so much.\nWe don’t know about you, but the older we get the more we want to see, and the less people we have to see them with. Here is your opportunity to do the things you’ve always dreamed about; the adventures of a lifetime you’ve been promising out loud ‘One day... One day I’ll do that’. Well that One Day is here. We’re going to create amazing, wonderful trips for all of you to enjoy.\nSo who are we? We are a Group of Travel Specialists working with the largest vacation provider in the world, TL Network. We have access to thousands of hotels worldwide, hundreds of cruising dates and ships, and almost every tour company on the planet, all with one system; and, as many of you know, when you travel as a group you get the best prices.\nImagine 50 gals worldwide booking one cruise…. The group rate is just so much better. 12 is the minimum for a group rate, but we plan for way more, so our prices won’t be beaten. Nowhere on the planet will you get a better price! We have a great team of women here at Vellinga’s Travel & Cruise Holiday that have been selling travel for over 80 years, and we’re excited to share our knowledge and passion of the Travel Industry with you, our sisters!!\nOur main objective is to ensure that you have a safe, happy and amazing trip. Your membership fee will allow for a host on every single trip that we promote. That alone means having peace of mind - knowing that you have someone that will be looking out for your best interests while away in a city or country that you are not familiar with. They will meet all of you on the first day and stay with you for your entire vacation to ensure that you have all of your questions answered, and to help you with everything you need.\nBesides all of this, imagine coming together with gals from countless cities worldwide: South Korea, Australia, USA, Canada, UK, Brazil, Africa; speaking different languages, with one thing in common - the sense of adventure and community. You’ll have the ability to keep in contact with them through WhatsApp, our Facebook group, Instagram, emailing and texting where possible.\nOnce you’ve made friends with these gals, you will be able to travel with them over and over again with Brave Women Travel. We promise exciting and fun-filled holidays year after year at unbeatable prices.\nWe have tons of ideas for great adventures, but we want you to tell us what you want to do; because if you want to do it, we’re sure 50 other women want to do it too. Share with us your dream of a lifetime; the adventure you heard about as a child and never made happen… Let’s make it happen together.\nWe want you to invite all of your friends to join the Brave Women Travel Meet-Up group. Every woman that you know that is looking for that sense of community. We’re hoping that in no time we will be able to book out a cruise ship, just for Brave Women Travel worldwide. We want to hear from you, because 2000 minds are better than 5… So tell us where you want to go.\nHere are some ideas that we’ve been talking about as a team.\nSeoul, South Korea for shopping and spa treatments (best in the world) in October 2016 and again in April 2017\nNile cruise\nThailand & Cambodia\nBuenos Aires, Argentina\nAntarctica 12-day cruise – A must see for sure!
